      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ethan, a 9th grader interested in mechanical engineering, robotic engineering, and CAD design. I fell in love with engineering when I got my first remote controlled car. I wanted to create similar systems to the rc car, so I searched through Youtube and other online sources further expanding my interest in engineering. Throughout the years past, I continued research and even created my own designs.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pulley System Cable Car With Mechanical Braking</strong> – This project is a fully mechanical cable car system that moves along a string by the use of a unidirectional, compound pulley system. The mechanical braking system is triggered by a station peg which causes a trip lever to set the wedge in between the cable and a fixed brake pad. Once the wedge is fully set in place, it triggers a falling weight to slowly pull the wedge out until the car continues moving again.

  <h3>Engineering Goals of Project</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design a fully mechanical, self stopping and resetting cable car model</li>
    <li>Explore simple mechanical linkages and passive timing</li>
    <li>Use materials found at home</li>
  </ul>

      <h3>Materials</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cardboard - car body, pulley support, wedge</li>
    <li>fishing wire - cable, pulley string, string for wedge release</li>
    <li>metal clip - pulley system</li>
    <li>rubber eraser - stationary brake pad</li>
    <li>popsicle stick - brake triggers</li>
    <li>toothpick - trigger for the start of the brake system</li>
    <li>pin - pivot for popsicles and pull pin</li>
    <li>washer - counter weight and hanging weight</li>
    <li>paperclip - the hook connected to the car and cable</li>
    <li>hot glue - to connect the pieces to the car</li>
  </ul>
</section>
    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p> The car glides along a cable, powered by a pulley and counterweight system which is attached to the car body. When the car reaches a station peg, it causes the trigger to spin counter clockwise which spins the popsicle stick that is connected to the wedge clockwise. When the popsicle stick connected to the wedge rotates, it hits the cable forcing the wedge backwards between the brake pad and cable, stopping the car. When the wedge is fully set in place, the string attached to the wedge tightens removing the pin and dropping the weight. The weight will slowly pull out the wedge until the car resumes movement.
