      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ethan, a 9th grader interested in mechanical engineering, robotic engineering, and CAD design. I fell in love with engineering when I got my first remote controlled car. I wanted to create similar systems to the rc car, so I searched through Youtube and other online sources further expanding my interest in engineering. Throughout the years past, I continued research and even created my own designs.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pulley System Cable Car With Mechanical Braking</strong> – This project is a fully mechanical cable car system that moves along a string by the use of a unidirectional, compound pulley system. The mechanical braking system is triggered by a station peg which causes a trip lever to set the wedge in between the cable and a fixed brake pad. Once the wedge is fully set in place, it triggers a falling weight to slowly pull the wedge out until the car continues moving again.
